# 👋 About Me
Hi there, I’m Emanuele Saccoliti!
- I'm a financial mathematics graduate with a strong quantitative focus on advanced financial modelling integrating market data and stochastic components. 
- My areas of interest are volatility modelling, especially stochastic rough volatility, and dynamic portfolio optimization.
- Recently I also started to explore the intersection of reinforcement learning, deep learning and generative AI methodologies applied to financial modelling and optimization.
- I define myself as a longlife learner, willing to constantly expand my horizons to fulfill my evergrowning curiosity.
- In my spare time, I love coding, playing music and staying up to date with the latest trends on finance and tech.
